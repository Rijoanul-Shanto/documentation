# Filtering

In this guide you will see how to configure and use Meilisearch filters in a hypothetical movie database.

## Configure filters

Suppose you have a collection of movies called `movie_ratings` containing the following fields:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 458723,
    "title": "Us",
    "director": "Jordan Peele",
    "genres": [
      "Thriller",
      "Horror",
      "Mystery"
    ],
    "rating": {
      "critics": 86,
      "users": 73
    },
    "overview": "Husband and wife Gabe and Adelaide Wilson take their…"
  },
  …
]
```

If you want to filter results based on the `director` and `genres` attributes, you must first add them to the `filterableAttributes` list:

<CodeSamples id="filtering_update_settings_1" />

**This step is mandatory and cannot be done at search time**. Updating `filterableAttributes` requires Meilisearch to re-configure your index, which will take an amount of time proportionate to your dataset size and complexity.

<Capsule intent="note">
By default, `filterableAttributes` is empty. Filters do not work without first explicitly adding attributes to the `filterableAttributes` list.
</Capsule>

## Using filters

After adding `director`, `release_date`, and `genres` to the [`filterableAttributes` index setting](//reference/api/settings#filterable-attributes), you can use them in your [filter expressions](/learn/filtering_and_sorting/filter_reference).

The following code sample returns `Avengers` movies released after 18 March 1995:

<CodeSamples id="filtering_guide_1" />

Use dot notation to filter results based on a document's [nested fields](/learn/engine/datatypes). The following query only returns thrillers with good user reviews:

<CodeSamples id="filtering_guide_nested_1" />

You can also combine multiple conditions. For example, you can limit your search so it only includes `Batman` movies directed by either `Tim Burton` or `Christopher Nolan`:

<CodeSamples id="filtering_guide_2" />

Here, the parentheses are mandatory: without them, the filter would return movies directed by `Tim Burton` and released after 1995 or any film directed by `Christopher Nolan`, without constraints on its release date. This happens because `AND` takes precedence over `OR`.

If you only want recent `Planet of the Apes` movies that weren't directed by `Tim Burton`, you can use this filter:

<CodeSamples id="filtering_guide_3" />

`NOT director = "Tim Burton"` will include both documents that do not contain `"Tim Burton"` in its `director` field and documents without a `director` field. To return only documents that have a `director` field, expand the filter expression with the `EXISTS` operator:

```
release_date > 1577884550 AND (NOT director = "Tim Burton" AND director EXISTS)
```

<Capsule intent="warning">
[Synonyms](/learn/configuration/synonyms) don't apply to filters. Meaning, if you have `SF` and `San Francisco` set as synonyms, filtering by `SF` and `San Francisco` will show you different results.
